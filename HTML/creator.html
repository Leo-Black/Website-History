				Born in the Netherlands in January 1956, Guido van Rossum attended the University of Amsterdam and did his master's in computer science and mathematics. He began working on Python in December 1989, where he needed a "hobby" programming project to do around Christmas. He was the Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) for Python until July 2018. However, he continues work on Python as a member of the Python Steering Council.
